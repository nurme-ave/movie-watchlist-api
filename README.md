## Overview

### Project Description

In this project I'm playing with 2 API calls: 1) the first call gets the IMDB ID number from the OMDb API (based on user input), and 2) based on the IMDB ID received from the first call, the second call retrieves the poster, title, IMDB rating, runtime, genre and full plot from the database. Once all the details have been retrieved they will be rendered on the page.

I have 2 HTML files here: 1) index.html - this is the search page with the search bar where all the search results will be displayed and the user has the option to add movies to the watchlist, and 2) watchlist.html - this page loads and displays data from local storage. By data I mean the movies the user has added to their watchlist. Here the user can also remove movies from the watchlist.

I also created a nice green search spinner which is displayed while the data is being fetched.

The page was built for desktop first after which I optimized it for smaller screens.
